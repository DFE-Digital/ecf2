An appropriate body can use the 'appropriate body portal' to record an induction outcome.

They need to confirm or update:

-   when induction started and ended
-   number of terms completed
-   induction programme type

ðŸ“ŠðŸ“œ This is the requirement for the DQT record.

There is validation to not allow future dates or an induction end date before the induction start date.

This is not the case when done in a mass upload as the DQT processes mass upload data overnight.

ðŸ’» This is because the system can't correct errors with validation rules as it's done on a template and will simply bounce them back a day after the upload once processed.
