title: Release an ECT
---

An appropriate body can release an ECT so that another school can claim them, or because the ECT dropped out of teaching.

They can also record an induction outcome of 'not yet completed' when they click to update induction details. 

'Not yet completed' means they did not finish their induction with that appropriate body.

Appropriate bodies need to provide the:

- induction start date - this is populated from what they previously gave when first claiming the ECT but can be edited
- induction end date
- number of terms served as a whole number - this can only be given at the point an outcome so is not already populated
- the induction programme type - this is populated from what they previously gave but can be edited 

Submitting this information updates the DQT.

'Not yet completed' is the only status option for an ECT leaving an AB regardless of the circumstances.

If an ECT drops out of teaching, the appropriate body does not update the ECT's record any differently. The record just remains as 'not yet completed'.

Sometimes, ECTs come back and finish induction much later. Their record stays as 'not yet completed' regardless of the reason why they left. This allows their record to be updated again in the future.
