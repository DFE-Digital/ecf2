title: Claim an ECT
---

Claiming an ECT is when an appropriate body informs the TRA whose induction they're quality assuring. They can do this using the 'appropriate body portal'.

They need to enter the ECT's:

- date of birth ðŸ”’
- teacher reference number ðŸ”’

This ensures that the AB only searches for ECTs they already have links with. The search locates the record in the database of qualified teachers (DQT).

If there is no TRN and DOB match, then an error message appears. The AB would then liaise with our induction data collections team or the teacher themselves.

When they claiming an ECT, the appropriate body also needs to enter the:

* induction start date
* type of programme (FIP, CIP, DIY)

When this data is submitted, the appropriate body user would see the employer ID and employer address. This is the same as the appropriate body ID, and should show the appropriate body address.

### Validation and issues with the appropriate body portal ðŸ’»

There is validation to make sure the induction start date is not before the ECT's QTS date. Induction should only start after the ECT has received QTS. If the ECT does not have QTS yet, the record will still show but there will be a blank field in the QTS date section.

There are some discrepancies in the rules on the portal. Future dates aren't allowed in the web update, but can get through the bulk import upload.

The end date of an induction period must be after the start date for an induction period.

If an AB tries to claim an ECT who is exempt from the web UI, or via a bulk upload, it gives a message saying they are exempt. Those who are exempt cannot be claimed as they don't need to be inducted in order to teach.

### Claiming an ECT who is already claimed

When an appropriate body user tries to view an ECT record to claim them,
if the ECT is already claimed by another appropriate body, it would
state they were 'in progress' and the appropriate body they were in
progress with.

ðŸ’» They are unable to change this on the service so the appropriate
body user would have to reach out to the other appropriate body or the
TRA induction support team to get them to release the ECT.

ðŸ“œ Sometimes, these appropriate bodies (particularly local
authorities due to policy changes) no longer exist so the induction
support team would help the ABs to navigate this.

### Policy caveats relating to claiming an ECT ðŸ“œ

An ECT cannot do induction if they previously failed it. [Policy states that those who have failed cannot reapply to practice teaching](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6629237f3b0122a378a7e6ef/Induction_for_early_career_teachers__England__statutory_guidance_.pdf).

[There are rules about who schools can and cannot appoint as an appropriate body](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/managing-training-for-early-career-teachers#appointing-an-appropriate-body).
