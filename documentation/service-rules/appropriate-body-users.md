## Appropriate body portal

### Get access to the TRA's appropriate body sign in

Access to the AB portal, and user management, is administered via DfE sign-in.

ðŸ”’ Within DfE Sign-In, each organisation has a nominated approver,
and that person (rather than DfE personnel) is responsible for
adminstering user requests for their organisation. This keeps the data
safe from people within organisations that should not have access to
it.

ABs as an organization are added or removed as needed through liaising
with the induction data collections team in the TRA (Teaching Regulation Agency) via email.

ðŸ”’ This means organisations can only get access that are legitimately
appropriate bodies. Policy outlining who can be an appropriate body:
[Appropriate bodies guidance - section
3:1](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/661d459fac3dae9a53bd3de6/Appropriate_bodies_guidance_induction_and_the_early_career_framework.pdf)


#### Status

- Alerts
- The date they achieved QTS
- Induction, which is the current status of their induction. 

This status would be one of the following: in progress, pass, fail, extended, not yet completed (when they have stopped induction with 
their current appropriate body but not finished their induction)

#### Teacher details

- Their title
- Forename
- Middle name(s)
- Surnames

#### Initial teacher training

- Qualification
- ITT establishment
- Programme type
- Subject 1
- Subject 2
- Subject 3
- Age range
- Course end date
- Course result
- Class and division

#### QTS status

- Qualified teacher status
- QTS date
- Date of Partial Recognition

#### Induction status

- Induction status (In progress/Not yet
    completed/Extended/Passed/Failed)
- Eligible to complete a one-year induction period under transition
    arrangements

ðŸ“œ This part was related to temporary provisions when the ECF came
in. If someone, as of 1 September 2021, had started but not completed
induction, they had until 31 August 2023 to complete induction under the
'old regs'. TRA populated this themselves, based on data they had. ABs
cannot edit it. The transition period is over, so this is now a 'no' for everyone.

### Viewing induction history

There are provisions in the regulations for ABs to offer a reduced
induction. Appropriate bodies have discretion to reduce the length of
the induction period to a minimum of one term (based on a school year of
three terms) to recognise previous teaching experience.

Induction history is shown, as subsection of induction status, if the
ECT has a previous appropriate body(s) than their current one.

ðŸ™‹ This section is so that ABs can track where their ECTs have been
and how much induction they have served elsewhere.

The induction history table shows the following:

- Previous appropriate bodies
- Start date (when the ECT started induction with the previous appropriate body)
- End date (when the ECT stopped doing induction with the previous appropriate body, but did not pass or fail -- this is when they are released)
- Number of terms (this must be a whole number, and this is given when the ECT is released)
- Induction programme type (FIP/CIP/DIY)

Below the induction history are 2 more subheadings:

- Extension period (when an AB doesn't pass or fail them, but decides to extend their induction, this part will specify how much longer their induction is)
- Induction status completion date (if passed, this will be the pass date, if failed, it will be the fail date)

The appropriate body user can claim the ECT for induction if they are
not already claimed by another appropriate body. If they are claimed by
another appropriate body, they would not be able to do this.

ðŸ™‹ This allows the TRA to keep track of where an ECT currently is or
how many ECTs under an AB without overlaps in data.

### Extend an ECT's induction

There is a field for extending number of terms. The inputs to populate
this field would be:

- Start date
- Programme type
- Length of the extension

If the person iscompleting their induction with the same AB, they don't
have to enter an end date or no. of terms. If the person is completing
their induction elsewhere, they must enter the end date and number of
terms.

### Mass actions to update an ECTs record for their induction status with the TRA

Mass actions refer to an AB's ability to upload mass induction data as
opposed to the standard 1 by 1 record updates for ECTs.

This is done by uploading a CSV file (template given by the TRA) onto
the portal. The columns on the file are the same as the details needed
on the individual record but this allows ABs to update the TRA with all
their ECT's data much quicker.

You can also release an ECT and extend them using the mass upload file.

This is processed overnight so there are no immediate error messages
unlike the updating 1 record at a time route.

The TRA support team would email the AB of any discrepancies that
flagged up overnight and ask them to amend the errors.

Due to the processing happening overnight the ABs wouldn't receive
notifications to alert them of any errors and the system doesn't have a
way to update them built in, therefore the only way to amend errors is
via contacting the ABs through help desk.

There are some discrepancies in the rules on the portal. Future dates
aren't allowed in the web update, but can get through the bulk import.

## Check data for appropriate bodies

### Access to the service

The appropriate body nominates the users who require access by emailing
support. Support would then raise this as a second line ticket to the
policy and engagement team. The policy team would contact the lead
provider working with this appropriate body to confirm the user was
valid. There is admin functionality where they can then add users to the
appropriate body in the Manage ECT admin tooling.

ðŸ”’ Only approved appropriate body users can be added to view this data.
As the check data service shows personal information for ECTs, it would
be a GDPR breach to show this to users that do not require access.

ðŸ“œ There were strict directions from policy to define who had access to
this data. This is why it is escalated to policy teams, not just support
teams. Appropriate bodies are often delivery partners too. The Appropriate
bodies and regulation team gives information to the policy team on who
is serving as an appropriate body. 

Those users will then receive an email notification that they can sign
in.

ðŸ’»The email notification is used to alert users they can use the
service.

If an appropriate body also acts as a delivery partner, access is given
to each check data service separately.

ðŸ’» Some appropriate bodies may be delivery partners, but they have
differing responsibilities for each role, and in theory might be
responsible for different ECTs. Delivery partners are also responsible
for mentors, not just ECTs.

ðŸ”’ Splitting the responsibility up allows them to see what is relevant
for their role for their organisation. Some colleagues may only be
responsible for appropriate body responsibilities, not delivery partner
responsibilities, or vice versa.

### Sign in to the service

The user, if granted access, can try to sign in. This will then send
them a 'magic link' in an email to enable sign in.

ðŸ’» Magic link approach was decided to be the best sign in option at the
time.

If the appropriate body user is also granted access to the check data
for delivery partner service or any other related services, they will be
required to state which role they need to carry out for that session.

ðŸ’» Some appropriate bodies may be delivery partners, but they have
differing responsibilities for each role, and in theory might be
responsible for different ECTs. Delivery partners are also responsible
for mentors, not just ECTs.

ðŸ”’ Splitting the responsibility up allows them to see what is relevant
for their role for their organisation. Some colleagues may only be
responsible for appropriate body responsibilities, not delivery partner
responsibilities, or vice versa.

### View data for ECTs registered by SITs to their appropriate body

The data that is available to view in the service is the data submitted
by SITs in the Manage ECTs service about ECTs.

ðŸ™‹ðŸ“Š This was built for appropriate bodies to cross-reference with
their own data and information on ECTs with what schools had submitted
in Manage ECTs. This could be useful when submitting other data to the
Teaching Regulation Agency as well.

It also meant that appropriate bodies could follow up when necessary
with schools, for example when:
* a school has indicated they are using the appropriate body on
    Manage ECTs, but has not registered the ECT's details directly with
    them
* a school has registered an ECT's details directly with them but has
    not registered the ECT correctly on Manage ECTs
* an appropriate body has concerns that fidelity checks (needed for
    both CIP and DIY) may be required for an ECT's induction
* an appropriate body may need to use this to double-check they have
    successfully registered for induction any ECTs on the TRA AB portal

There was also a hope that showing this information schools had
submitted on Manage ECTs, would reduce the workload of appropriate
bodies having to ask schools for the same information again in other
places.

Appropriate bodies cannot see any data about mentors.

ðŸ”’ Appropriate bodies are responsible for the induction of new
teachers. They are not responsible for any training mentors receive and
do not need to see their data.

If there are users allocated to multiple appropriate bodies, they can
choose from a list of appropriate bodies which one they want to view the
data for.

ðŸ’» This seems to be just how it was built, and a way for the user to
check what they needed to for their role as a particularly appropriate
body. It's unlikely or unheard of for someone to work for multiple
appropriate bodies.

It only shows data for the current academic year.

ðŸ’» This seems to be just how it was built, and it wasn't a priority to
expand to other academic years.

#### Fields that can be viewed about an ECT

- Full name
- TRN
- School URN
- Status (defined below)
- Induction type (FIP, CIP or DIY)
- Induction tutor (their email)

ðŸ“ŠðŸ™‹ There was an exercise to consider what appropriate body would need
to see. The first 3 fields help them to ascertain if the ECT has been
correctly registered with them and matches their records. Most of these
fields are relevant to what an appropriate body would need to submit to
the TRA, or what school and who they would need to contact if there were
any issues. Information on the induction type also informs appropriate
bodies to if they need to do fidelity checks or not.

#### Statuses for an ECT

- Contacted for information
- No induction registered - Check you've registered this ECT's induction with the Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA)
- Not eligible for funded training - This means the ECT has either completed, failed, or is exempt from serving their induction
- Checking QTS - We're awaiting confirmation of their qualified teacher status (QTS)
- Induction confirmed - An induction period has been registered with the Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA) for this ECT
- Participant deferred - This participant's provider has reported that they've deferred. Contact the provider if you think this is wrong
- ECT not currently linked to you - The school has indicated you're no longer acting as the appropriate body for this ECT
- Induction completed - The Teaching Regulation Agency has recorded that this ECT completed their induction on 30 June 2023.

ðŸ“ŠðŸ™‹ The statuses were transformed from how they appear to school users
in Manage ECT to be more relevant to what appropriate bodies would need
to see. They can help an appropriate know what they might need to
action, e.g. to check in with a school if they're not eligible, or to
make sure they've registered them for induction in the TRA AB portal.

#### Filters a user can apply

- Search by school name, URN, ECT name or TRN
- Filter by status

ðŸ™‹ This helps appropriate bodies filter to ECTs they are interested in
finding out about. For example, filtering by status allows them to see ECTs where they do not have induction registered on the TRA's AB portal. They could then
follow up these queries with the school induction tutor or school. Equally, filtering by school can allow them to check that the school
has registered on Manage ECTs correctly all the ECTs they are
responsible for the induction of.

### Download the data as a CSV

The data shown on the page is downloaded as a CSV. It remembers the
filters or search that has been applied.

ðŸ™‹ This is to help with appropriate bodies processes and record
keeping, so they can choose to compare the data in Manage ECTs, the
TRA's AB portal and their own systems how they want to. They can also
use this to export data which will later disappear when the service
updates to the next academic year.
