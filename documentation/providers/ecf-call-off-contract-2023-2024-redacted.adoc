... The Contractor shall deliver the Services in accordance with their
service proposal at Schedule 1: Part 2, based upon a recruitment target
of [REDACTED]ECTs and [REDACTED]Mentors, and the relative Per
Participant Pricing based on the payment bands in Table 1.

.. Service Fee
[arabic]
... Subject to the terms of the Contract, the Service Fee will be paid
to the Contractor on a monthly basis, with effect from the Service
Commencement Date on the basis set out in Paragraphs 1.3.2, 1.3.3, and
until the expiry of the Call-off Contract.

... The Service Fee is capped at 40% of the Total Contract Value. Any
additional Participants enrolled on the programme will be paid as
follows:
[arabic]
.... For additional participants up to 115% of the recruitment
target, the Department will adjust the Service Fee at the end of the
recruitment window (31 July 2023) to align to actual Start Declarations
and backpay any Service Fee payments.

.... Additional participants in excess of 115% of actual Start
Declarations, and no more than 150%, will only be eligible for payment
with prior agreement from the Department and will be paid the full
Volume Banded Per Participant Price in line with the Output Payment
milestones.

... The Service Fee will be a fixed amount per month, based on the
total Service Fee sum in the Pricing Schedule, divided by the period
stated in Paragraph 1.3.1.

... The Contractor must submit invoices by the 25^th^ of every month,
with the first invoice to be submitted by the 25^th^ June 2023.

... If by 31^st^ December 2023, the staffing headcount profile of the
Contractor is less than 75% of what was specified in the Pricing
Template at the point of tender, the Department reserves the right to
adjust the monthly Service Fee until the staff in post hits the target
profile.

... As per paragraph 25 of Part 1 of Schedule 2, if by 31st October
2023, 31 December 2023 or 31 March 2024, the Contractor fails to recruit
75% of the recruitment target as set out in Annex 2 to Schedule 2: Part
1, then the Department reserves the right to validate the actual costs
incurred by the Contractor and may adjust the monthly Service Fee as
follows:
[arabic]
.... If the Contractor has not submitted eligible Start Declarations
equivalent to 75% of the recruitment target on 31^st^ October 2023, or
31^st^ December 2023, reduce the Service Fee payments to 75% of the
current value; and

.... If the Contractor has not submitted eligible Start Declarations
equivalent to 75% of the recruitment target on 31 March 2024, reduce the
Service Fee to a value equivalent to the actual number of participants
recruited.

... Where a Service Fee reduction is triggered, as per paragraph
1.3.6, then the Contractor shall invoice at the reduced value from the
month following the recruitment milestone.

.. Output Payments
[arabic]
... Subject to the terms of the Contract, the Department shall pay the
Contractor the applicable Output Payment for each Output that is
achieved in accordance with the requirements of the Contract. The
applicable Output Price shall be ascertained by reference to Table 3
below.

... In order to trigger payment for Output 1 – Participant Start, each
Participant must start on the programme by 31^st^ December 2023. If a
Participant that was signed up prior to 31^st^ December does not intend
on starting the programme, the Contractor may replace them with another
Participant by 31^st^ December 2023.

... If a Participant withdraws prior to the start of the programme and
an Output Payment is made for that Participant due to incorrect
information being supplied by the Contractor or school, the Department
will be eligible to claw back this payment as per paragraph 1.4.11.

... In order to trigger payment for Outputs Retention Point 1 –
Retention Point 4, the Participant must remain enrolled and engaged on
the course until the Milestone Date specified in the table below. If a
Participant drops off in between two retention points, an output payment
will be paid for the period between retention points but no output
payments will be made past that point as the Contractor is no longer
delivering to that Participant. Contractors will need to have a policy
on what happens if a Participant drops off the programme.

|===

... In order to trigger payment for Output 6 – Participant Completion,
each Participant must remain enrolled and engaged on the programme, as
per paragraph 1.4.9, by 31st July 2025 and be on track to complete the
programme.

... If a Participant is not on track to complete the programme by 31st
July 2025 due to going on maternity leave, sabbatical leave, working
part-time or due to illness, but the Participant will continue the
programme, the Contractor can invoice over a tailored timeframe which
would need to be agreed with Department, subject to variation of the
Contract to extend the Contract Period in accordance with Clause 2.2 of
this Call-off Contract. Output Payments made cannot exceed the total
amount of Output Payments eligible per Participant in the Pricing
Schedule. Contractors must have a policy on Participants undertaking a
reduced term of induction of at least 1 academic year and for the above
scenarios.

... The Department will pay the Contractor Output Payments based on
accurate MI returns, including the details below:
[arabic]
.... The School’s URN, contact details of the Induction Co-ordinator
(including name, telephone number and email address), date school signed
up, date school withdrew/reason for withdrawal when appropriate and
reason for school not signing up with the Contractor.

.... The Participant’s TRN, role, name, Date of Birth, working
pattern, email address, date Participant signed up, confirmation of
Participants continued involvement and reason for withdrawal/deferral
where applicable.

... The Contractor must submit to the Department evidence that each
Participant remains engaged on the programme before Output Payments 2 to
6 are made. Examples of acceptable evidence of a participant remaining
engaged with the programme include, but are not limited to, confirmation
of a participant attending a training event or confirmation of a
Participant completing a minimum of 50% of the self-directed study.

... In the event that the Contractor is unable to evidence a
Participants ongoing engagement as per clause 1.4.9, they may provide
alternative evidence, such as confirmation from the School that the
Participant remains engaged in the programme. Where the Department is
not satisfied with the evidence submitted, it reserves the right to
request further information in order to validate a claim made by the
Contractor and withhold the Output Payment until satisfactory evidence
of continued engagement is submitted. The Department may also conduct
spot checks to verify the data is accurate by cross-referencing with
other MI returns or contacting Schools to validate participation
engagement data.

... If an MI return or evidence submitted by the Contractor of
continued engagement is not accurate, and when the Department validates
and verifies the data provided it emerges that payments have been made
for Participants who did not start or remain on the course, the
Department will clawback payments made.

.. Charges for Volume Banded Output Payments
[arabic]
... Payment will be made based upon the successful delivery of each
individual output as set out in Table 3.

... Table 3 - Output Payments
The following volume based Output Payments shall apply during the
Contract:

... The relevant Volume Bands applicable to each Output Payment will
be re-calculated at the milestone date and will be based on the number
of active participants in the cohort at that point.

.. Uplift Payment
[arabic]
... The Department will make an Uplift Payment to the Contractor for
each Participant when they start on the programme at Output 1 –
Participant Start, if they fulfil the criteria in Paragraph 1.6.2.

... To be eligible for the Uplift Payment, the Participant must be in
a school that is either in one of the 20% most sparse LADs nationally or
has at least 40% of pupils eligible for pupil premium. The Department
will issue a list of schools and Local Department Districts that are
eligible for Uplift Payments prior to each Annual Cohort Competition.

... If the Participant is at a school that is both in one of the 20%
most sparse LADS nationally and has at least 40% of pupils eligible for
pupil premium, the Department will pay the Contractor the same Uplift
Payment as a Participant who meets one of the specified criteria.

... If, in accordance with Paragraphs 1.6.1 and 1.6.2, the Uplift
Payment is payable, it shall be calculated on the basis of it being £100
per Participant.

... The Contractor must invoice for the Uplift Payment when submitting
all invoices in relation to Output 1. The Department will validate that
the Participant meets the criteria and retains the right to clawback
funds in relation to the Uplift Payment if after payment it emerges that
the Participant does not meet the criteria.

.. Replacement Mentors
[arabic]
... If an ECT loses a mentor during the course of the programme, then
a new mentor can replace the originally allocated mentor. If this
replacement mentor is new to the programme, they will be considered a
‘replacement mentor’ for the purposes of this contract. A replacement
mentor should be offered Part 1 and Part 2 of the Mentor Training
Programme at the earliest opportunity, while joining Part 3 of the
training at a point that aligns with their ECT. A replacement mentor is
entitled to undertake the full Mentor Training Programme, with a
separate per participant fee being payable to that of the original
mentor. A replacement mentor should be placed on a replacement mentor
schedule, this will enable Lead Providers to submit the appropriate
declarations for that mentor. Further information on the payment
structure for replacement mentors can be found in the payment guidance.

[arabic, start=2]
. Pricing of Variations
[arabic]
.. The provisions of this Paragraph 2 shall apply to the pricing of any
Variation (or proposed Variation) and the calculation of any change to
the Charges consequent upon a Variation (or proposed Variation).

.. The Parties acknowledge that a Variation or proposed Variation may
have an impact on the Charges in one or more of the following ways –
[arabic]
... One-off cost, in which case Paragraph 2.5 shall apply;

... Subject to the Contractor’s obligation to mitigate increases in
the Charges, a Process Variation may result in an amendment to the
Output Prices on which the Charges are based, in which case Paragraph
2.6 shall apply;

... The cost of any up-front investment by the Contractor in order to
achieve a Variation as set out in Paragraph 2.2.2, in which case
Paragraph 2.7 shall apply.

.. In any of the cases referred to in Paragraphs 2.2.1 to 2.2.3 above,
and without prejudice to Paragraph 2, the Contractor shall use the
Pricing Schedule at Annex 2 of this schedule to demonstrate and justify
any claim for additional or reduced Charges and/or proposed revisions to
the Output Payment on which the Charges are based arising as a result of
any proposed Variation.

.. Where a Variation is requested by either Party under the Change
Control Procedure then, subject to the terms of the Change Control
Procedure, the Contractor shall at its own cost prepare, populate and
submit for the Department’s approval a specific version of the Pricing
Schedule demonstrating the impact of the proposed Variation which shall:
[arabic]
... Be based on and reflect the principles of the Pricing Model having
regard to any assumptions stated in the Pricing Model which affect the
Charges;

... Include estimated volumes of each type of resource to be employed
and the applicable average annual salary for resource employed specified
in the Pricing Model;

... Include full disclosure of any assumptions underlying such a
quotation. The Department reserves the right to request further clarity
around these assumptions and the underlying calculations until it is
satisfied as to their validity; and

... Include evidence of the cost of any assets required for the
Variation.

.. Where Paragraph 2.2.1 applies:
[arabic]
... The Contractor shall be paid in full upon completion, or by an
agreed schedule of milestone payments (both payment options subject to
meeting specified acceptance criteria agreed at the outset).

... The Department shall issue a separate purchase order and the
Contractor shall raise a separate invoice or credit note in respect of
the one-off cost.

.. Where Paragraph 2.2.2 applies:
[arabic]
... Any necessary changes to the Output Prices for any or all of the
volume bandings shall be effected by means of changes to the relevant
Output Prices set out in Table 3.

... Any necessary changes to the Output Prices will be in accordance
with the original requirements for the completion of the Pricing
Schedule as set out in the Invitation to Tender, for example the maximum
cap on Service Fee will still apply.

... The Output Prices shall not be adjusted more than once a quarter.
The date any Output Price adjustment (“Price Adjustment Effective Date”)
takes effect shall be at the start of the quarter immediately following
implementation of the Variation in question. For example, where a
Process Variation is implemented during the month of September in a
Contract Year; the relevant Output Prices shall be adjusted with effect
from 1 October in that Contract Year. If there are several adjustments
in one quarter, these will be aggregated to make one adjustment at the
start of the next quarter.

... The Department shall provide the Contractor with a revised Table 3
of this Schedule by the date any such Variation takes effect (1 January,
1 April, 1 July, 1 October).

... A Process Variation shall be implemented timeously, and such
implementation shall not await the Price Adjustment Effective Date.

... If a Process Variation is implemented and there is a demonstrable
financial loss to a Party due to the relevant Output Payment(s) not
being adjusted until the Price Adjustment Effective Date (first day of
next quarter), then the Party impacted in this way can seek recovery of
the amount due in the following manner:
[loweralpha]
.... If it is the Contractor, by submitting a separate invoice and
supporting documentation; or
.... If it is the Department, by issuing a credit note request and
supporting documentation.
+
Any request to seek recovery of such an amount must be submitted within
3 Months of the Price Adjustment Effective Date.

.. Where Paragraph 2.2.3 applies, the Process Variation element shall
be dealt with in accordance with Paragraph 2.6 above and any up-front
investment required to implement such a Process Variation shall itself
be dealt with through an adjustment to the relevant Output Price(s)
under Paragraph 2.6 above or treated as a one-off cost in accordance
with Paragraph 2.5 above.

.. Following implementation of a Variation, the Department shall make
any necessary consequential changes and/or updates to Table 3 of this
Schedule 2: Part 1.

and backpay any Service Fee payments.

.... Additional participants in excess of 115% of actual Start
Declarations, and no more than 150%, will only be eligible for payment
with prior agreement from the Department and will be paid the full
Volume Banded Per Participant Price in line with the Output Payment
milestones.

... The Service Fee will be a fixed amount per month, based on the
total Service Fee sum in the Pricing Schedule, divided by the period
stated in Paragraph 1.3.1.

... The Contractor must submit invoices by the 25^th^ of every month,

Template at the point of tender, the Department reserves the right to
adjust the monthly Service Fee until the staff in post hits the target
profile.

... As per paragraph 25 of Part 1 of Schedule 2, if by 31st October
2024, 31 December 2024 or 31 March 2025, the Contractor fails to recruit
75% of the recruitment target as set out in Annex 2 to Schedule 2: Part

31^st^ December 2024, reduce the Service Fee payments to 75% of the
current value; and

.... If the Contractor has not submitted eligible Start Declarations

month following the recruitment milestone.

.. Output Payments
[arabic]
... Subject to the terms of the Contract, the Department shall pay the
Contractor the applicable Output Payment for each Output that is
achieved in accordance with the requirements of the Contract. The
applicable Output Price shall be ascertained by reference to Table 3
below.

... In order to trigger payment for Output 1 – Participant Start, each
Participant must start on the programme by 31^st^ December 2024. If a
Participant that was signed up prior to 31^st^ December does not intend
on starting the programme, the Contractor may replace them with another

will be eligible to claw back this payment as per paragraph 1.4.11.

... In order to trigger payment for Outputs Retention Point 1 –
Retention Point 4, the Participant must remain enrolled and engaged on
the course until the Milestone Date specified in the table below. If a
Participant drops off in between two retention points, an output payment
will be paid for the period between retention points but no output

... In order to trigger payment for Output 6 – Participant Completion,
each Participant must remain enrolled and engaged on the programme, as
per paragraph 1.4.9, by 31st July 2026 and be on track to complete the
programme.

... If a Participant is not on track to complete the programme by 31st

programme, the Contractor can invoice over a tailored timeframe which
would need to be agreed with Department, subject to variation of the
Contract to extend the Contract Period in accordance with Clause 2.2 of
this Call-off Contract. Output Payments made cannot exceed the total
amount of Output Payments eligible per Participant in the Pricing
Schedule. Contractors must have a policy on Participants undertaking a
reduced term of induction of at least 1 academic year and for the above
scenarios.

... The Department will pay the Contractor Output Payments based on
accurate MI returns, including the details below:
[arabic]
.... The School’s URN, contact details of the Induction Co-ordinator

6 are made. Examples of acceptable evidence of a participant remaining
engaged with the programme include, but are not limited to, confirmation
of a participant attending a training event or confirmation of a
Participant completing a minimum of 50% of the self-directed study.

... In the event that the Contractor is unable to evidence a
Participants ongoing engagement as per clause 1.4.9, they may provide
alternative evidence, such as confirmation from the School that the
Participant remains engaged in the programme. Where the Department is
not satisfied with the evidence submitted, it reserves the right to
request further information in order to validate a claim made by the
Contractor and withhold the Output Payment until satisfactory evidence
of continued engagement is submitted. The Department may also conduct
spot checks to verify the data is accurate by cross-referencing with
other MI returns or contacting Schools to validate participation
engagement data.

... If an MI return or evidence submitted by the Contractor of
continued engagement is not accurate, and when the Department validates
and verifies the data provided it emerges that payments have been made
for Participants who did not start or remain on the course, the
Department will clawback payments made.

.. Uplift Payment
[arabic]
... The Department will make an Uplift Payment to the Contractor for
each Participant when they start on the programme at Output 1 –
Participant Start, if they fulfil the criteria in Paragraph 1.6.2.

... To be eligible for the Uplift Payment, the Participant must be in
a school that is either in one of the 20% most sparse LADs nationally or
has at least 40% of pupils eligible for pupil premium. The Department
will issue a list of schools and Local Department Districts that are
eligible for Uplift Payments prior to each Annual Cohort Competition.

... If the Participant is at a school that is both in one of the 20%
most sparse LADS nationally and has at least 40% of pupils eligible for
pupil premium, the Department will pay the Contractor the same Uplift
Payment as a Participant who meets one of the specified criteria.

... If, in accordance with Paragraphs 1.6.1 and 1.6.2, the Uplift
Payment is payable, it shall be calculated on the basis of it being £100
per Participant.

... The Contractor must invoice for the Uplift Payment when submitting
all invoices in relation to Output 1. The Department will validate that
the Participant meets the criteria and retains the right to clawback
funds in relation to the Uplift Payment if after payment it emerges that
the Participant does not meet the criteria.

.. Replacement Mentors
[arabic]
... If an ECT loses a mentor during the course of the programme, then
a new mentor can replace the originally allocated mentor. If this
replacement mentor is new to the programme, they will be considered a
‘replacement mentor’ for the purposes of this contract. A replacement
mentor should be offered Part 1 and Part 2 of the Mentor Training
Programme at the earliest opportunity, while joining Part 3 of the
training at a point that aligns with their ECT. A replacement mentor is
entitled to undertake the full Mentor Training Programme, with a
separate per participant fee being payable to that of the original
mentor. A replacement mentor should be placed on a replacement mentor
schedule, this will enable Lead Providers to submit the appropriate
declarations for that mentor. Further information on the payment
structure for replacement mentors can be found in the payment guidance.

[arabic, start=2]
. Pricing of variations
[arabic]
.. The provisions of this Paragraph 2 shall apply to the pricing of any
Variation (or proposed Variation) and the calculation of any change to
the Charges consequent upon a Variation (or proposed Variation).

.. The Parties acknowledge that a Variation or proposed Variation may
have an impact on the Charges in one or more of the following ways –
[arabic]
... One-off cost, in which case Paragraph 2.5 shall apply;

... Subject to the Contractor’s obligation to mitigate increases in
the Charges, a Process Variation may result in an amendment to the
Output Prices on which the Charges are based, in which case Paragraph
2.6 shall apply;

... The cost of any up-front investment by the Contractor in order to
achieve a Variation as set out in Paragraph 2.2.2, in which case
Paragraph 2.7 shall apply.

.. In any of the cases referred to in Paragraphs 2.2.1 to 2.2.3 above,
and without prejudice to Paragraph 2, the Contractor shall use the
Pricing Schedule at Annex 2 of this schedule to demonstrate and justify
any claim for additional or reduced Charges and/or proposed revisions to
the Output Payment on which the Charges are based arising as a result of
any proposed Variation.

.. Where a Variation is requested by either Party under the Change
Control Procedure then, subject to the terms of the Change Control
Procedure, the Contractor shall at its own cost prepare, populate and
submit for the Department’s approval a specific version of the Pricing
Schedule demonstrating the impact of the proposed Variation which shall:
[arabic]
... Be based on and reflect the principles of the Pricing Model having
regard to any assumptions stated in the Pricing Model which affect the
Charges;

... Include estimated volumes of each type of resource to be employed
and the applicable average annual salary for resource employed specified
in the Pricing Model;

... Include full disclosure of any assumptions underlying such a
quotation. The Department reserves the right to request further clarity
around these assumptions and the underlying calculations until it is
satisfied as to their validity; and

... Include evidence of the cost of any assets required for the
Variation.

.. Where Paragraph 2.2.1 applies:
[arabic]
... The Contractor shall be paid in full upon completion, or by an
agreed schedule of milestone payments (both payment options subject to
meeting specified acceptance criteria agreed at the outset).

... The Department shall issue a separate purchase order and the
Contractor shall raise a separate invoice or credit note in respect of
the one-off cost.

.. Where Paragraph 2.2.2 applies:
[arabic]
... Any necessary changes to the Output Prices for any or all of the
volume bandings shall be effected by means of changes to the relevant
Output Prices set out in Table 3.

... Any necessary changes to the Output Prices will be in accordance
with the original requirements for the completion of the Pricing
Schedule as set out in the Invitation to Tender, for example the maximum
cap on Service Fee will still apply.

... The Output Prices shall not be adjusted more than once a quarter.
The date any Output Price adjustment (“Price Adjustment Effective Date”)
takes effect shall be at the start of the quarter immediately following
implementation of the Variation in question. For example, where a
Process Variation is implemented during the month of September in a
Contract Year; the relevant Output Prices shall be adjusted with effect
from 1 October in that Contract Year. If there are several adjustments
in one quarter, these will be aggregated to make one adjustment at the
start of the next quarter.

... The Department shall provide the Contractor with a revised Table 3
of this Schedule by the date any such Variation takes effect (1 January,
1 April, 1 July, 1 October).

... A Process Variation shall be implemented timeously, and such
implementation shall not await the Price Adjustment Effective Date.

... If a Process Variation is implemented and there is a demonstrable
financial loss to a Party due to the relevant Output Payment(s) not
being adjusted until the Price Adjustment Effective Date (first day of
next quarter), then the Party impacted in this way can seek recovery of
the amount due in the following manner:
[loweralpha,start=3]
.... If it is the Contractor, by submitting a separate invoice and
supporting documentation; or
.... If it is the Department, by issuing a credit note request and
supporting documentation.
+
Any request to seek recovery of such an amount must be submitted within
3 Months of the Price Adjustment Effective Date.

.. Where Paragraph 2.2.3 applies, the Process Variation element shall
be dealt with in accordance with Paragraph 2.6 above and any up-front
investment required to implement such a Process Variation shall itself
be dealt with through an adjustment to the relevant Output Price(s)
under Paragraph 2.6 above or treated as a one-off cost in accordance
with Paragraph 2.5 above.

.. Following implementation of a Variation, the Department shall make
any necessary consequential changes and/or updates to Table 3 of this
Schedule 2: Part 1.

[arabic]
. Service levels and KPIs.
[arabic]
.. This section sets out the Service Levels and Key Performance
Indicators (KPIs) against which the Parties shall measure the
Contractor’s performance.

.. The objective of the Service Levels and KPIs is to:
[arabic]
... ensure that the Services are of a consistently high quality and
meet the requirements of the Department;

... provide a mechanism whereby the Department can attain meaningful
recognition of inconvenience and/or loss resulting from the Contractor's
failure to deliver the Services; and

... incentivise the Contractor to meet the performance standards and
to remedy any failure to meet the required standards expeditiously.

=== Service Levels

[arabic, start=3]
.. The Contractor shall ensure compliance with the Service Levels
listed in Table 1 (Service Levels).

.. The Contractor and the Department shall monitor the Contractor’s
performance against each of the Service Levels listed in Table 1
(Service Levels).

.. The Contractor shall complete and return the monthly DfE Reporting
Template outlining performance against the Service Levels to date and
confirm whether they have been achieved.

.. If the Contractor fails to meet one (1) or more Service Levels in
any Reporting Period, or fails to meet any one Service Level in
consecutive reporting periods, the Department will require the
Contractor to provide the Department with a plan for addressing and
resolving the Service Level failures and issue a suspended Service
Credit in line with paragraph 1.6.1.
[arabic]
... If the failure is resolved and the Contractor meets the failed
Service Levels by the end of the next reporting period then the Service
Credit will be avoided. If one or more of the failed Service Levels are
failed in the next reporting period then the Service Credit will be
upheld.

.. If the Contractor fails the Service Levels as detailed in paragraph
1.6 for three (3) consecutive reporting periods, or on four (4) separate
occasions, then it will be considered a ‘Service Failure’ and the
Department reserves the right to take action in line with paragraphs
2.11 to 2.13 (Consequence of Service Failure).

continuous improvement, respond to feedback and adopt best practice in
regard to content and delivery for both ongoing and future cohorts.
... Service Development – activity that requires the Contractor to make
considerable revisions to their content and/or delivery to a level
whereby it is not possible to implement mid-cohort and therefore will
only be required for future cohorts. In this instance the Contractor
should attempt to implement any such aspects of the recommendation that
can be made under paragraph 3.6.1 but will not be required to implement
the full recommendation until the next cohort Call Off.
... Urgent Service Development – activity that requires the Contractor to
make immediate and significant revisions to their content and/or
delivery in regard to ongoing cohorts that will result in additional
cost to the Contractor. In this instance the Contractor may charge the
Department for any reasonable development costs, subject to agreement by
the Department.
.. If the Contractor fails to implement a Service Improvement
recommendation to the required standard as set out by the Department
within the specified timescale then the Department may, at its sole
discretion take action in line with paragraphs 2.11 to 2.13 (Consequence
of Service Failure) and issue a Service Credit.

==== Quality and Performance

[arabic, start=8]

|===

.. Where an Improvement Plan is required, it should include clear
actions and mitigations to address the recommendations including,
timelines, milestones and any interim performance measures to enable
management of progress against the plan. Improvement Plans will need to
be agreed with the Department in line with the following schedule:
[arabic]
... Draft version issued to the Department no less than 1 week prior
to the publication of the Inspection Report; and

... Final plan agreed no later than 2 weeks after the publishing of
the report.

.. The Department will use the Ofsted inspection reports as part of
the wider performance management procedures and in addition to the
direct response’s outlined in table 3a, if in the Departments opinion,
concerns are identified that have, or are considered likely to have, a
negative impact on service quality, governance or participant
satisfaction then the department reserves the right to take action in
line with paragraphs 2.11 to 2.13 (Consequence of Service Failure).

.. If the Contractor is issued a suspended Service Credit and the
Improvement Plan is resolved to the required standard and within the
specified timescale then the Service Credit will be avoided. If, in the
opinion of the Department, the Improvement Plan has not been resolved in
full within the timescales then it will be considered a ‘Service
Failure’, and the Service Credit will be upheld.

the Ofsted inspection reports as evidence in applying any other terms
within this Call-off Contract or the Framework Agreement.

==== QA Reporting

[arabic, start=13]
.. The Department reserves the right to use, which may include publishing
under government transparency policy, reporting data on Contractors
performance against the QA Function requirements as a means of
demonstrating the ‘quality’ performance of the Framework. The reporting
metrics are likely to be, but are not limited to:
[arabic]
... Service Improvements – % of recommendations adopted within
timescales.
... Quality and Performance – number of recommendations and Service
Failures.
.. Ofsted will publish all inspection reports in full at
https://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/.

.. within three calendar months of the Service Continuity Plan (or any
part) having been invoked pursuant to Paragraph 9;
.. within 14 days of a Financial Distress Event;
.. within 30 days of a Corporate Change Event; and
.. where the Department requests any additional reviews (over and above
those provided for in Paragraphs 7.1(a) to 7.1(d)) by notifying the
Contractor to such effect in writing, whereupon the Contractor shall
conduct such reviews in accordance with the Department's written
requirements. Prior to starting its review, the Contractor shall provide
an accurate written estimate of the total costs payable by the
Department for the Department’s approval. The costs of both Parties of
any such additional reviews shall be met by the Department except that
the Contractor shall not be entitled to charge the Department for any
costs that it may incur above any estimate without the Department’s
prior written approval.
. Each review of the Service Continuity Plan pursuant to Paragraph 7.1
shall be a review of the procedures and methodologies set out in the
Service Continuity Plan and shall assess their suitability having regard
to any change to the Services or any underlying business processes and
operations facilitated by or supported by the Services which have taken
place since the later of the original approval of the Service Continuity
Plan or the last review of the Service Continuity Plan and shall also
have regard to any occurrence of any event since that date (or the
likelihood of any such event taking place in the foreseeable future)
which may increase the likelihood of the need to invoke the Service
Continuity Plan. The review shall be completed by the Contractor within
the period required by the Service Continuity Plan or, if no such period
is required, within such period as the Department shall reasonably
require. The Contractor shall, within 20 Working Days of the conclusion
of each such review of the Service Continuity Plan, provide to the
Department a report (a “*Review* *Report*”) setting out:
[loweralpha]
.. the findings of the review;
.. any changes in the risk profile associated with the Services; and
.. the Contractor's proposals (the “*Contractor's Proposals*”) for
addressing any changes in the risk profile and its proposals for
amendments to the Service Continuity Plan following the review detailing
the impact (if any and to the extent that the Contractor can reasonably
be expected to be aware of the same) that the implementation of such
proposals may have on any services or systems provided by a third party.
. Following receipt of the Review Report and the Contractor’s Proposals,
the Department shall:
[loweralpha]
.. review and comment on the Review Report and the Contractor’s
Proposals as soon as reasonably practicable; and
.. notify the Contractor in writing that it approves or rejects the
Review Report and the Contractor’s Proposals no later than 20 Working
Days after the date on which they are first delivered to the Department.
. If the Department rejects the Review Report and/or the Contractor’s
Proposals:
[loweralpha]
.. the Department shall inform the Contractor in writing of its reasons
for its rejection; and
.. the Contractor shall then revise the Review Report and/or the
Contractor’s Proposals as the case may be (taking reasonable account of
the Department's comments and carrying out any necessary actions in
connection with the revision) and shall re-submit a revised Review
Report and/or revised Contractor’s Proposals to the Department for the
Department's approval within 20 Working Days of the date of the
Department's notice of rejection. The provisions of Paragraph 7.3 and
this Paragraph 7.4 shall apply again to any resubmitted Review Report
and Contractor’s Proposals, provided that either Party may refer any
disputed matters for resolution by the Dispute Resolution Procedure at
any time.
. The Contractor shall as soon as is reasonably practicable after
receiving the Department's approval of the Contractor's Proposals
(having regard to the significance of any risks highlighted in the
Review Report) effect any change in its practices or procedures
necessary so as to give effect to the Contractor's Proposals. Any such
change shall be at the Contractor’s expense unless it can be reasonably
shown that the changes are required because of a material change to the
risk profile of the Services.
. TESTING OF THE SERVICE CONTINUITY PLAN
. The Contractor shall test the Service Continuity Plan on a regular
basis (and in any event not less than once in every Contract Year).
Subject to Paragraph 8.2, the Department may require the Contractor to
conduct additional tests of some or all aspects of the Service
Continuity Plan at any time where the Department considers it necessary,
including where there has been any change to the Services or any
underlying business processes, or on the occurrence of any event which
may increase the likelihood of the need to implement the Service
Continuity Plan.
. If the Department requires an additional test of the Service
Continuity Plan, it shall give the Contractor written notice and the
Contractor shall conduct the test in accordance with the Department's
requirements and the relevant provisions of the Service Continuity Plan.
The Contractor's costs of the additional test shall be borne by the
Department unless the Service Continuity Plan fails the additional test
in which case the Contractor's costs of that failed test shall be borne
by the Contractor.
. The Contractor shall undertake and manage testing of the Service
Continuity Plan in full consultation with the Department and shall
liaise with the Department in respect of the planning, performance, and
review, of each test, and shall comply with the reasonable requirements
of the Department in this regard. Each test shall be carried out under
the supervision of the Department or its nominee.
. The Contractor shall ensure that any use by it or any Sub-contractor
of “live” data in such testing is first approved with the Department.
Copies of live test data used in any such testing shall be (if so
required by the Department) destroyed or returned to the Department on
completion of the test.
. The Contractor shall, within 20 Working Days of the conclusion of each
test, provide to the Department a report setting out:
[loweralpha]
.. the outcome of the test;
.. any failures in the Service Continuity Plan (including the Service
Continuity Plan's procedures) revealed by the test; and
.. the Contractor's proposals for remedying any such failures.
. Following each test, the Contractor shall take all measures requested

SCHEDULE 13 – CONDUCT OF CLAIMS

*1. INDEMNITIES*

1.1 This Schedule shall apply to the conduct, by a Party from whom an
indemnity is sought under this Agreement (the “Indemnifier”), of claims
made by a third person against a party having (or claiming to have) the
benefit of the indemnity (the “Beneficiary”).

1.2 If the Beneficiary receives any notice of any claim for which it
appears that the Beneficiary is, or may become, entitled to
indemnification under this Agreement (a “Claim”), the Beneficiary shall
give notice in writing to the Indemnifier as soon as reasonably
practicable and in any event within 10 Working Days of receipt of the
same.

1.3 Subject to Paragraph 2, on the giving of a notice by the
Beneficiary, where it appears that the Beneficiary is or may be entitled
to indemnification from the Indemnifier in respect of all (but not part
only) of the liability arising out of the Claim, the Indemnifier shall
(subject to providing the Beneficiary with a secured indemnity to its
reasonable satisfaction against all costs and expenses that it may incur
by reason of such action) be entitled to dispute the Claim in the name
of the Beneficiary at the Indemnifier’s own expense and take conduct of
any defence, dispute, compromise or appeal of the Claim and of any
incidental negotiations relating to the Claim. If the Indemnifier does
elect to conduct the Claim, the Beneficiary shall give the Indemnifier
all reasonable cooperation, access and assistance for the purposes of
such Claim and, subject to Paragraph 2.2, the Beneficiary shall not make
any admission which could be prejudicial to the defence or settlement of
the Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifier.

1.4 With respect to any Claim conducted by the Indemnifier pursuant to
Paragraph 1.3:

{empty}(a) the Indemnifier shall keep the Beneficiary fully informed and
consult with it about material elements of the conduct of the Claim;

{empty}(b) the Indemnifier shall not bring the name of the Beneficiary
into disrepute;

{empty}(c) the Indemnifier shall not pay or settle such Claim without
the prior written consent of the Beneficiary, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed; and

{empty}(d) the Indemnifier shall conduct the Claim with all due
diligence.

shall be free to pay or settle any Claim on such terms as it thinks fit
and without prejudice to its rights and remedies under this Agreement
if:

{empty}(a) the Indemnifier is not entitled to take conduct of the Claim
in accordance with Paragraph 1.3;

{empty}(b) the Indemnifier fails to notify the Beneficiary in writing of
its intention to take conduct of the relevant Claim within 10 Working
Days of the notice from the Beneficiary or if the Indemnifier notifies
the Beneficiary in writing that it does not intend to take conduct of
the Claim; or

{empty}(c) the Indemnifier fails to comply in any material respect with
the provisions of Paragraph 1.4.

*2. SENSITIVE CLAIMS*

2.1 With respect to any Claim which the Beneficiary, acting reasonably,
considers is likely to have an adverse impact on the general public's
perception of the Beneficiary (a “Sensitive Claim”), the Indemnifier
shall be entitled to take conduct of any defence, dispute, compromise or
appeal of the Sensitive Claim only with the Beneficiary's prior written
consent. If the Beneficiary withholds such consent and elects to conduct
the defence, dispute, compromise or appeal of the Sensitive Claim
itself, it shall conduct the Sensitive Claim with all due diligence and
if it fails to do so, the Indemnifier shall only be liable to indemnify
the Beneficiary in respect of that amount which would have been
recoverable by the Beneficiary had it conducted the Sensitive Claim with
all due diligence.

2.2 The Beneficiary shall be free at any time to give written notice to
the Indemnifier that it is retaining or taking over (as the case may be)
the conduct of any Claim, to which Paragraph 1.3 applies if, in the
reasonable opinion of the Beneficiary, the Claim is, or has become, a
Sensitive Claim.

*3. RECOVERY OF SUMS*

3.1 If the Indemnifier pays to the Beneficiary an amount in respect of
an indemnity and the Beneficiary subsequently recovers (whether by
payment, discount, credit, saving, relief or other benefit or otherwise)
a sum which is directly referable to the fact, matter, event or
circumstances giving rise to the Claim, the Beneficiary shall forthwith
repay to the Indemnifier whichever is the lesser of:

{empty}(a) an amount equal to the sum recovered (or the value of the
discount, credit, saving, relief, other benefit or amount otherwise
obtained) less any out-of-pocket costs and expenses properly incurred by
the Beneficiary in recovering or obtaining the same; and

{empty}(b) the amount paid to the Beneficiary by the Indemnifier in
respect of the Claim under the relevant indemnity.

*4. MITIGATION*

reasonable steps to minimise and mitigate any loss for which the
