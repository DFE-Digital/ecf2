# Offboarding ticket

We need to make sure that people whoâ€™ve left the team no longer have access to key systems. 

A service now leaver request should do most of the action required, but there are some which need to be done manually: 

## For delivery manager 

- [ ] Raise Service Now Request, this will take care of
  - [ ] MS systems
  - [ ] O365 access
  - [ ] GitHub
  - [ ] JIRA/Confluence
  - [ ] Lucid
     

- [ ] Manually Remove:
  - [ ] the Admin Console
  - [ ] Notify
  - [ ] Trello
  - [ ] Slack access
